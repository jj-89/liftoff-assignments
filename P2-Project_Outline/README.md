### What I'll Have to Learn
I have had to learn what code is generated for a project automatically by Entity Framework and how to manipulate that to Add/Remove features, fields, and models. 

I have also had to furhter my understanding of basic CRUD operations and how they are implemented in ASP.NET Core. 

I am currently working on using joins in Entity Framework to enable my call log feature to be in the format of small blog-like posts that will record the DateTime as well as which user made the call.
